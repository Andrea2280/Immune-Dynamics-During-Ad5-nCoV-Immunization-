## Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), driven by SARS-CoV-2, is a severe infectious disease that has become a global health threat. Vaccines are among the most effective public health tools for combating COVID-19. Immune status is critical for evaluating the safety and response induction of the vaccine, but the evolution of the immune response during immunization remains poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing represents a powerful tool for dissecting multicellular behavior and discovering therapeutic antibodies. Here, by performing scRNA/V(D)J-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four COVID-19 vaccine trial participants longitudinally during immunization, we revealed enhanced cellular immunity with concerted and cell-type specific IFN responses as well as boosted humoral immunity with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Based on the CDR3 sequence and germline enrichment, we were able to identify several potential binding antibodies. We synthesized, expressed and tested 21 clones from the identified lineages, and one monoclonal antibody (P3V6-1) exhibited high affinity with the extracellular domain of Spike protein, which might be a promising therapeutic reagent for COVID-19. Overall, our findings provide insightful knowledge and a framework for assessing vaccine through the novel scRNA/V(D)J-seq approach, which might facilitate the development of more potent, durable and safe prophylactic vaccines.


## Highlights
1. We illustrated that scRNA/V(D)J-seq, as a powerful analytical tool, provided insights in safety assessment and immune dynamics characterization of vaccine candidates.
2. ScRNA/V(D)J-seq suggested that Ad5-nCoV conferred protective and balanced responses by inducing both cellular and humoral immunity.
3. Potent binding antibodies were directly predicted based on CDR3 sequence and germline enrichment.
4. One S-ECD-specific mAb, P3V6-1, might be a promising therapeutic reagent for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
